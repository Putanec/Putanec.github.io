<h1> Bali </h1>I went here when I was younger, but I still remember the good memories. One was how nice everyone was. Everyone I met was always ready to help or stirke up conversation. Also the secenry was so pretty. All the sites were amazing to look at. Another memory was the delicious food. All the fruit was fresh and the vetablges were cooked to perfection. Another thing I went to was the monkey sanctuary. </body>
